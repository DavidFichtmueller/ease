	Atmosphere
		o abb:
		o syn:
		o imp:
		o des: An atmosphere is a layer of gases surrounding a planet or other material bodies
		       of sufficient mass. It is held in place by the gravity of the body (WP)

		Troposphere
			o abb:
			o syn:
			o imp:
			o des: The troposphere is the lowest portion of Earth's atmosphere (WP). It reaches
			       into ~ 15 km height and is part of the biosphere

		Stratosphere
			o abb:
			o syn:
			o imp:
			o des: The stratosphere is the second layer of Earth's atmosphere, just above the
			       troposphere, and below the mesosphere (WP). It reaches into ~ 50 km height and
			       is part of the biosphere

		Mesosphere
			o abb:
			o syn:
			o imp:

			o des: The mesosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere. The mesosphere is directly
			       above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere (UCAR-EDU). It reaches into
				~ 80 km height.

		Ionosphere
			o abb:
			o syn:
			o imp:
			o des: The Ionosphere comprises the thermo and the exosphere and parts of the upper
			       mesosphere (WP). The ionosphere is ionized by solar radiation.

			Thermo sphere
				o abb:
				o syn:
				o imp:
				o des: The thermosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere. The thermosphere is directly
				       above the mesosphere and below the exosphere (WTTU). It reaches into ~ 500 km height
					and is ionized by solar radiation.

			Exosphere
				o abb:
				o syn:
				o imp:
				o des: The exosphere is the outermost layer surrounding a planetary body as he earth (WP, M). It
					is ionized by solar radiation and only affected by low gravity
