			Process Time Scale #{{{

				o des: The time scale is an essential part of the process context. It describes the
				       the time range a process takes to develop visible impacts on actors and
				       compartments in a described system. If no general information is available on
				       how long the process takes to become visible in the literature the time of
				       observation can be used as an value of thumb as this time scale already allowed
				       to show a process.

	Service
	Function

	# This has been moved over from processes as we rather caputre a methodological aspect here.
	# We allow to say something about the overarching perspective of a dataset. Does it caputre
	# a service or not and when yes which one is it? So we will get also a nice link of variables
	# captured in the service context.
